  <h1>About the Author</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Gabriel Bene</strong> — a Cloud and Site Reliability Engineer
    with a strong focus on <strong>Azure, Kubernetes, and Terraform</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have over <strong>9 years of experience</strong> designing, operating, and
    supporting cloud infrastructure and container platforms, working across
    enterprise-scale environments and mission-critical systems.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Focus On</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Azure Landing Zone architecture and governance</li>
    <li>Platform engineering and shared cloud services</li>
    <li>Kubernetes and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</li>
    <li>Infrastructure as Code with Terraform</li>
    <li>Reliability, observability, and automation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why This Project Exists</h2>
  <p>
    This homelab is a practical learning and experimentation platform where I
    apply real-world cloud and platform engineering patterns in a controlled
    environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is not just to deploy resources, but to design a
    <strong>governance-first, modular, and evolvable Azure foundation</strong>,
    similar to what is used in production enterprise environments.
  </p>

  <h2>Professional Background</h2>
  <p>
    I currently work as a <strong>Site Reliability Engineer</strong>, contributing
    to large-scale cloud-native platforms built on Azure and Kubernetes.
    Previously, I supported and engineered container platforms at Microsoft,
    worked as a DevOps and systems engineer in regulated environments, and
    built strong foundations in Linux, networking, and infrastructure operations.
  </p>

  <p>
    My experience spans:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enterprise Azure and Kubernetes platforms</li>
    <li>CI/CD pipelines and GitHub Actions</li>
    <li>Observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, Thanos)</li>
    <li>Infrastructure automation and reliability engineering</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Certifications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>CKA – Certified Kubernetes Administrator</li>
    <li>CKAD – Certified Kubernetes Application Developer</li>
    <li>Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate</li>
    <li>Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert</li>
  </ul>
